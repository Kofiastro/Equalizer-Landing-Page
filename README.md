## My process
Using Tailwindcss i have been able to work on designs much faster and i want to learn more by working on more projects at frontendmentor to help me be good at it.

### Built with

- Html && CSS

### What I learned

8th project using css.This was an old project i did when i started with css.I was faced with making the black and orange container overlap on each other.this is when i discovered using relative and absolute and it worked well.

```css
   .mobileimage {
        position: relative;
        margin: -160px 350px;
        width: 312px;
        height: 632px;
    }

    .orangeContainer {
        position: absolute;
        margin: -450px 58px 80px 1130px;
        border-radius: 12px;
        background-color: var(--soft-red);
        width: 446px;
        height: 610px;
        color: var(--light-grayish-orange);
    }


```
